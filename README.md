# HyperOS GMS Keeper

An LSPosed module that runs only in Android's `system_server` process. It prevents
HyperOS Aurogon/Greeze from freezing the entire GMS UID after the screen has been
off for an extended period, which would also remove FCM heartbeat, queue-check,
and idle-reconnect alarms.

## Root Cause and Hook Scope

On a Xiaomi HyperOS `OS4` (Android 17), the ROM
calls the following method 60 seconds after the screen turns off:

```text
com.miui.server.greeze.GreezeManagerService.triggerGMSLimitAction(): void
```

This method runs only when the device uses the China region, GMS limiting is
enabled, and the screen is off. On the tested ROM, it first removes
`com.google.android.gms` from the Aurogon allowlist and then calls
`triggerQuickFreeze(uid, 0)` for each running GMS UID across all users. The
subsequent transaction freezes the UID, disables its network state, and causes
AlarmManager to remove alarms belonging to that UID.

This module returns before that dedicated GMS-limiting entry point executes. It
does not hook the general-purpose freezer or modify power-saving policies for
other apps. This prevents the same transaction from removing the allowlist entry,
freezing the GMS UID, and deleting FCM alarms.

## Installation

1. Install the generated APK. With a device connected, you can run:

   ```powershell
   adb install -r .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\HyperOS-GMS-Keeper-1.1.0-debug.apk
   ```

2. Make sure your LSPosed implementation supports libxposed API 102, then enable
   the module. Its scope is statically set to `system` (`system_server`).
3. Reboot the device. Force-stopping an app is not enough to reload a
   `system_server` hook.

The module has no launcher entry and does not modify system files. If the class
or method above does not exist on the current ROM, the module only records the
hook failure in the LSPosed log; it does not fall back to intercepting freeze
operations for every app.

## Verification

First, confirm this message appears in the LSPosed log:

```text
HyperOSGmsKeeper: hook installed in system_server; scope is limited to system
```

After the screen has remained off longer than the ROM's original trigger delay,
the following message should appear:

```text
HyperOSGmsKeeper: blocked GreezeManagerService.triggerGMSLimitAction()
```

Then run the connection probe included in this repository:

```powershell
.\fcm-connection-probe.ps1
```

The GMS UID should no longer be frozen by Greeze/cgroup, and the FCM connection
to port `5228` should remain connected or reconnect automatically after a
disconnect. This module only addresses the upstream GMS connection lifecycle.
Notification delays caused by restrictions on the target app still need to be
handled separately.

## Building

JDK 17 or 21 and Android SDK Platform 34 are required. JDK 25 is currently
incompatible with the Gradle/Android Gradle Plugin versions used by this project.

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### GitHub Actions Release Signing

The Actions workflow builds a non-debuggable, signed release APK. Add the
following secrets under `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions` in the
repository:

- `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded signing keystore
- `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`: Keystore password
- `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`: Key alias
- `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`: Key password

To create a dedicated signing keystore for the first release:

```powershell
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore release.jks -alias hyperos-gms-keeper -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```

To copy the Base64-encoded keystore to the clipboard in PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release.jks")) | Set-Clipboard
```

Do not commit `release.jks`; `.gitignore` already excludes `*.jks` and
`*.keystore`. Back up the same keystore after the first release because all
future APKs must use the same signing key to support in-place updates.
